# hello-nwjs

## Introduction

Test project for NW.js. Currently works on Mac.

This project currently does nothing useful, and is just a small sample to help you bootstrap creating your own NW.js app.

If you already have a website written in HTML/CSS/JS, it should be very easy to convert your website into a standalone desktop app!

## Quick Start

**Pre-requisites:**

1. Downloaded NW.js
2. Add nwjs executable to your $PATH.
   - export PATH="$PATH:[PATH-TO-UNZIPPED-NWJS]/nwjs-sdk-v0.46.0-osx-x64/nwjs.app/Contents/MacOS"
3. I think npm is optional, but not sure.

**Running the App:**

You can run the project using one of two ways:
1. `./run` (might need one-time initialization command: `chmod 755 run`)
2. `npm run run`
